# Real-Life-Traffic-Simulation-Using-SUMO
Step-by-step instructions to create a real-life simulation using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO).
This step-by-step guide was created so others could replicate a realistic simulation using SUMO in any city of the world.
We recommend using this guide if you are working with traffic flows simulation using SUMO.
All files generated are included in the repository.

First, read the Step-by-Step instructions to be familiar with the procedure, all files mentioned in the guide are provided to create the same simulation for the city of Ibarra
as well as the generated output files obtained from SUMO.
