# Real-Life-Traffic-Simulation-Using-SUMO
Step-by-step instructions to create a real-life simulation using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO).
This step-by-step guide was created so others could replicate a realistic simulation using SUMO in any city of the world.
We recommend using this guide if you are working with traffic flows simulation using SUMO.
Please comment anything that is still confusing or if you need extra explanation in an specific subject.
